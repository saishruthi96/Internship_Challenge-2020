# Maverick.io Summer 2020 Internship Challenge Project

## Problem Statement: 
Predict which kind of plant we can grow at different locations depending on the environment

## Data
Train Data : [here](https://github.com/saishruthi96/Internship_Challenge-2020/blob/master/capstone_train.csv.zip)<br/>
Test Data: [here](https://github.com/saishruthi96/Internship_Challenge-2020/blob/master/capstone_test.csv)

## Tasks:
* Create a report on key insights derived from Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Create a multi-class prediction model to predict the species of plant which will survive in the neighborhood of a given environment. 
* Create key segments for all the plants (train + test) based on the average sunlight received throughout the day and their distance from waterbody to identify which segments of plants are getting enough sunlight and water vs which ones are not. This will help in mobilizing resources to track growth of trees appropriately. 

## Results
Notebook with models and results [here](https://github.com/saishruthi96/Internship_Challenge-2020/blob/master/Maverick.io.challenge.ipynb)
